										<h2>Special Note From The Developers</h2>
										
										<p>This is only Notepad RT's inaugural edition (also known as 1.0) so be kind. We think this app is very feature complete. But you'll be glad to hear Version 1.1 is already in the works, along with the usual bug fixes you can look forward to cloud syncing options, an improved recent files interface, and find and replace with regular expressions. We hope you enjoy Notepad RT as much as we enjoyed making it!</p>
										
										<p>We're very open to comments and suggestions. Bug reports and feature request can be directed to our Feedback and Support page. Look forward to much more soon!</p>
